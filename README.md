# stock_project
Using Google Colab and a Tesla csv file, this program creates interactive candlesticks with Python using the plotly library that is mainly used for plotting data. I then added a 3 moving average trading strategy for Tesla's stock. I am working on adding predictions for trading strategies using Python, to this project including Bollinger bands and OBV (on-balance volume)
